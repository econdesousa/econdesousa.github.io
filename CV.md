1. **Profile**

I´m holding three degrees in Mathematics and over the years I had developed very good programming skills on several environments and languages such as MATLAB, R, Python, ImageJ Macro, or Linux Shell Scripting.

I have a particular interest on the development and application of software for mathematical modeling, simulation and data analysis for the study of biological processes, from bioimage analysis, to neurosciences, population genetics, genomics and metabarcoding.

I&#39;m also interested in lecturing at advanced courses and/or workshops.
